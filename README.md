# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Implementation of Monte Carlo Method 

Problem description:
There is a rectangular integer infinite grid, which intersections can be traversed through vertically or horizontally direction no further than to the neighboring node.
Software implementation is to be made to estimate the least possible number of steps using the Monte Carlo method, when randomly walking along the grid, starting from 
the origin of the grid. The distance between the origin and the stopping point must be, on average, greater than five.
